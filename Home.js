                <h2>Hello!</h2>
                <p> always knew from a young age that I was a creative person,
                but didn't necessarily know how to express my creativity,  or where to direct it.  
                However, over time, I learned that invention and innovation were my true passions, 
                allowing me to take full advantage of my creative skill set.  
                I have a strong desire to be part of something big enough to change the world for the better
                through technology. 

                In high school, I found a way to express my creativity when I pursued the Science stream
                alongside the Information Technology subject, which has been significant in guiding me on my software
                development career path.
                I now find myself as a Computer Science graduate at the University of Western Cape, where I acquired the
                necessary skills and knowledge towards become a software developer.

                Since my first exposure to Information Technology, I got to apply my creativity in several different ways:
                projects and Information Technology related competitions, and got to learn more and more. 
                My confidence and vision into what space I want to be involved in as an individual has been clear ever
                since.  

                I can now identify myself as an individual whose passion is directed towards being a software developer.
                I am also an individual who values hard-work and dedication along with honesty to achieve any goal set. 
                Finally all this vision I had from a young age since high is my main motivation for applying at SovTech. 
                I believe that SovTech is a perfect environment for me to take a step further towards building my career, and 
                I also believe at SovTech I can fully develop as individual, personal and professionally.</p>
